Welcome to my website!

I'm an applied microeconomist with an interest in labour, public, and organizational economics.

I'm currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Labour Economics, University of Basel. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Tilburg University.

You can find here my [CV](/files/CV_Bernasconi.pdf).
