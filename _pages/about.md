Welcome to my website!

I'm an applied microeconomist with an interest in labour and organizational economics.

I'm currently a PhD student at the Department of Econometrics at Tilburg University. As of September 2024, I'll join the University of Basel as a Postdoctoral researcher.

You can find here my [CV](/files/CV_Bernasconi.pdf).
