Welcome to my website!

I'm an applied microeconomist with an interest in labour economics and organizational economics.
I'm currently a fourth year PhD student at the Department of Econometrics at Tilburg University. I expect to graduate in summer 2024. 

You can find here my [CV](/files/CV_Bernasconi.pdf).
