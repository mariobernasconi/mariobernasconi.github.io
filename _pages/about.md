Welcome to my website!

I'm an applied microeconomist with an interest in labour economics and organizational economics. I'm currently a third year PhD student at the Department of Econometrics and Operations Research, Tilburg University. I expect to graduate in summer 2024. 

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_Bernasconi.pdf).
